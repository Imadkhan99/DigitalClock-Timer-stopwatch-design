Digital Clock Timer stopwatch Date designed using logic blocks in Proteus
Project EE-221 Lab
 Digital clock 
Summary
Our project of digital logic design is a Digital clock .it is based on logical flip-flops used as counter, i.e. IC 7490 is a simple (0-9) counter. Digital clock is a 24 hour clock comprises of seconds minutes and hour display. Alarm is set for minutes and hour on same display which is used for clock. Stopwatch is also on same display, having start stop and reset options. Week days are shown by bright green and red led’s while for date a separate 2 digit display counter is used .For temperature sensing  by ADC0804 led are used .   
Extra feature
	Alarm clock
	Stopwatch 
	Date (0-31)
	Day (7 days a week 
	Temperature sensor using LEDS
Problems Faced
	Finance issues.
	Supply of voltages.
	seven segments display and IC failure 
	Issue of clock pulse.
	Restricting the hours on 24.
	Coupling
	Bounce of Switch

Problems solutions
	We got support from Giki lab store, they provide us with breadboard, wires and some of IC.
	Power supply was a big issue for IC for which we used variable dc supply by transforming AC to dc.
	Initially some of IC and displays were not performing well which delayed our work.
	Function generator from 555 timer was created for pulse generation.
	And gates were used for restricting firstly the 2 digit than connecting with 4 in another and so that it reset before 24.
